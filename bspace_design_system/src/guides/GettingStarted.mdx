# BSpace App Demo

This example demos consumption of federated modules from a Webpack bundle. `probation` app depends on a component exposed by `main` app.

---

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start` . This will build and serve both `main` and `probation` on ports 3002 and 3001 respectively.

- HOST (main): [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
- REMOTE (probation): [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)

# Running Cypress E2E Tests

To run tests in interactive mode, run  `npm run cypress:debug` from the root directory of the project. It will open Cypress Test Runner and allow to run tests in interactive mode. [More info about "How to run tests"](../../cypress/README.md#how-to-run-tests)

To build app and run test in headless mode, run `yarn e2e:ci`. It will build app and run tests for this workspace in headless mode. If tets failed cypress will create `cypress` directory in sample root folder with screenshots and videos.
